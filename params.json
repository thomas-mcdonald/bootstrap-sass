{"name":"bootstrap-sass","tagline":"bootstrap-sass is bootstrap for Sass, ready to roll","body":"# Bootstrap for Sass\r\n\r\n`bootstrap-sass` is an Sass-powered version of [Twitter's Bootstrap](http://github.com/twitter/bootstrap), ready to drop right into your Sass powered applications.\r\n\r\nEnjoy.\r\n\r\n## Updating\r\nUpdating your application to a new version of `bootstrap-sass`? See [our changelog](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), [Bootstrap's changelog](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/wiki/Changelog), and this [guide to updating to Bootstrap 2.0](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/upgrading.html)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Rails\r\n\r\nIn your Gemfile:\r\n\r\n    gem 'sass-rails', '~> 3.1'\r\n    gem 'bootstrap-sass', '~> 2.0.2'\r\n\r\n#### CSS\r\n\r\nImport \"bootstrap\" in your SCSS file of choice to get all of Bootstrap's styles, mixins and variables! We recommend against using `//= require` directives, since none of your other stylesheets will be [able to use](https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass/issues/79#issuecomment-4428595) the awesome mixins that Bootstrap has defined.\r\n\r\n    @import \"bootstrap\";\r\n\r\nNeed to configure a variable or two? Simple define the value of the variable you want to change *before* importing Bootstrap. Sass will respect your existing definition rather than overwriting it with the Bootstrap defaults. A list of customisable variables can be found in the [Bootstrap documentation](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/less.html#variables).\r\n\r\n    $primaryButtonBackground: #f00;\r\n    @import \"bootstrap\";\r\n\r\n**Note**: It's important that the file you are importing is not named `bootstrap`, since this will cause an import loop. As a general rule, errors are something you should try to avoid.\r\n\r\n#### Javascripts\r\n\r\nYou can include the Bootstrap javascripts through two methods. In this case, Sprocket's `//= require` directives are useful, since there is no better alternative.\r\n\r\nWe have a helper that includes all available javascripts:\r\n\r\n    // Loads all Bootstrap javascripts\r\n    //= require bootstrap\r\n\r\nYou can also load individual modules, provided you sort out any related dependencies.\r\n\r\n    //= require bootstrap-scrollspy\r\n    //= require bootstrap-modal\r\n    //= require bootstrap-dropdown\r\n\r\nSimples.\r\n\r\n### Compass\r\n\r\n`bootstrap-sass` 2.0 now comes with support for Compass, meaning projects that don't use Rails can get in on the fun Bootstrap web.\r\n\r\n#### New project\r\n\r\nInstall the gem and create a new project using the gem.\r\n\r\n    gem install bootstrap-sass\r\n    compass create compass-test -r bootstrap-sass --using bootstrap\r\n\r\nThis will sort a few things out:\r\n\r\n* You'll get a starting `styles.scss` ready for your alterations\r\n* You'll get a compiled stylesheet compiled & ready to drop into your application\r\n* We'll also copy the Bootstrap javascripts & images into their respective folders for you, absolutely free of charge! How cool is that?\r\n\r\n#### Existing project\r\n\r\nInstall the gem, add the require statement to the top of your configuration file, and install the extension.\r\n\r\n    gem install bootstrap-sass\r\n\r\n    # In config.rb\r\n    require 'bootstrap-sass'\r\n\r\n    compass install bootstrap\r\n\r\nYou'll get the same benefits as those starting from scratch. Radical.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAs per the Bootstrap project we don't include the responsive styles by default. `@import \"bootstrap-responsive\";` to get them.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
